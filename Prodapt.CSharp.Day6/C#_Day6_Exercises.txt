Exercise 1:
Write a program that accepts integer array and an integer. List all the elements in the array that are greater than the value of given integer. Print the result in descending order.

Sample Input 1:
input1: [1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 15, 24]
input2: 17

Sample Output 1: [24]

Sample Input 2:
input1: [4, 8, 2, 6, 5, 12]
input2: 5

Sample Output 2: [12, 8, 6]

create a class library  with a method GetElements() which accepts an integer array and the integer as input and returns an integer array. 
If there is no element found in input1, then store -1 to the first element of output array.
Create a console application which would get the input and call the method GetElements() present in the class library. If the return value is -1 then, print "No element found".
