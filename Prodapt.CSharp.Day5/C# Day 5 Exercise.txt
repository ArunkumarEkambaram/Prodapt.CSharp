Exercise 1:
Corporate university wants to maintain the information about participants scores in various modules. 
Write a program to store the details of the marks scored in various modules.

Task 1: Create a library project and define a class called Participant. Create the following variables as follow:
	EmpId, Name, Company Name, FoundationMarks, WebBasicMarks, DotNetMarks, Total Marks, ObtainedMarks, Percentage
	Initialise the Total Marks to 300. ObtainedMarks and Percentage are calculated fields.

Task 2: Add 3 constructors, one Default, one parameterised to initialize the members and one static constructor to initialise the company Name to “Corporate Unniversity”

Task 3: Add the following functions to the class:
	a. To calculate Total Marks.
	b. To calculate the percentage.
	c. To display all the details

Task 4: Create a console application to accept the data about participants, and create the object. The console application should call the appropriate functions to calculate the Total Marks and Percentage. And then Display the percentage.

Exercise 2:
Create a class in the existing library project named Seller. Create the following variables are follows:
sellerId:string, sellerName:string, sellerIdCount:int
Create the following methods:
Static constructor- Seller( )
The static variable ‘sellerIdCount’ should be initialized to 1001.
Default constructor- Seller( )
The ‘sellerId’ should start with ‘S1001’ and should be incremented by 1 when a new object is created with the help of ‘sellerIdCount’. 
Eg: For the first seller the ‘SellerId’ should be S1001, for the second seller the ‘SellerId’ should be S1002 and so on.

Create a console application and invoke the constructors.
